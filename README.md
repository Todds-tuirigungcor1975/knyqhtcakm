Wow, Janym Qazaqstan. First off, it’s like this cacophony of sounds in there, popcorn crunching and people chatting just enough to tug you outta the story but you don’t even care because the screen pulls you back in. The theater was oddly sticky, why do they never clean up properly, right? It's like you could feel the popcorn history under your shoes.

First scene — bam, just like a whirlwind. The colors were like being inside a kaleidoscope while tripping on intense nostalgia. Still hear the dialogue in my head, half expect the guy next to me to start reciting lines out loud; gosh he kept whispering every two minutes. Kazakh folk music mixed oddly with 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern beats, you know, like putting soy sauce in your coffee but somehow it works. There was this little girl, eyes big like saucers, I swear she could see right through the screen into our souls.

>I was halfway through my popcorn when that scene with the eagle came up. Felt like it was flying straight towards me — I ducked instinctively, almost spilled my drink on the person next to me. The landscapes, man, they stretch on like my thoughts when I can’t sleep. Majestic, like nature's owning the entire plot. So much, in one frame, like packing a suitcase too tight.

The plot, ugh, sometimes felt like a stubborn knot in my back that doesn't unravel, but fascinating in that unsettling way, like when a cat stares at a ghost, you know? The lead actress, wow, she has this presence, like someone asking for a drink with just a look, no words. Makes you think deep existential thoughts mixed with mundane ones like “Should I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later or wait for 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨?” Somebody remind me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe alone so I can think.

That final scene, though! I’m not crying, you’re crying. Oh wait, those were also onion smells wafting in from the hallway. The director's touch like a Roomba trying to navigate a room full of obstacles, doesn’t always make sense but ends up cleaning up well somehow. 

And the script, at some points, as incoherent as my thoughts right now, but isn’t that the spell? A spell bound with Kazakh warmth and a touch of cosmic humor. Barely typed all this with my thumbs, hunching over this tiny keyboard like a poet without paper.

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , they said — capture that ineffable essence in a digital file. Can you even do that? Felt more like catching a sunbeam in your hand.
